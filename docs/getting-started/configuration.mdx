# Configuration

You can heavily customize Widgetbook by 
- building a component catalogue.
- making Components adjustable via Knobs.
- specify which properties are available via Add-ons.

## Components and variants

This documentation refers to Widgets as components since design tools like Figma use this terminology to describe their reusable UI elements. 
Components in Figma might be resembled by one or multiple variants which are variations of a component. 
In Flutter, the `TextButton`, `ElevatedButton` and `OutlineButton` are variants of a _Button_ component. 
In addition, different Flutter states of a button (e.g. `elevated` or `hovered`) might be resembled in Figma as additional variants.

## Adding components to the catalogue

In Widgetbook, developers create a folder tree structure to organize and catalogue components. 
Besides various elements to categorize all the components, Widgetbook features a _component_ and _use-case_ approach in which a single component has one or multiple use-cases.
A use-case might resemble a variant of a component or just a specific state of the component.

Components and use-cases are shown in the Widgetbook navigation.

<Info>Adding components to Widgetbook works different regarding the usage of the [manual approach](/getting-started/getting-started#approaches) or [generator approach](/getting-started/getting-started#approaches).</Info>

    ```dart title="Use-case definition for Container component"
    import 'package:widgetbook_annotation/widgetbook_annotation.dart';

    @WidgetbookUseCase(
      name: 'with green color',
      type: Container,
    )
    Widget greenContainerUseCase(BuildContext context) {
      return Column(
        children: [
          Container(
            color: Colors.green,
          ),
        ],
      );
    }
    ```

    Adding use-cases with the generator is based on the `@WidgetbookUseCase` annotation provided by the [widgetbook_annotation package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_annotation).

    #### Builder method

    The annotation is used on a builder method with a return type of `Widget` and a single required parameter `BuildContext`.
    
    <Info>
        You can freely pick the name of the method, but make sure the name of a newly created use-case builder method does not have a name conflict with already existing methods.
    </Info>

    In addition, `@WidgetbookUseCase` requires two mandatory parameters `type` and `name` that allow you to customize how the use-case is shown in the navigation of Widgetbook. 

    #### `type` property
    The `type` property is used by the generator to create the component entry within the navigation. 
    As a developer you want to specify the type of the catalogued component (in the example `Container`) instead of the one that might be returned by the builder method (in the example `Column`).

    #### `name` property
    The `name` property of the annotation allows you to specify the name of the use-case. 
    In the case of the example this is `with green color`.

    <Warning>Run the `build_runner` again via `flutter pub run build_runner build` or `flutter pub run build_runner watch` to update the Widgetbook with the newly created use-case.</Warning>
