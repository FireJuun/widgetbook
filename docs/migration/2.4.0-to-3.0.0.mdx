## Background

In order to support features as [#363](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook/issues/363), the Widgetbook API needed to be refactored to allow for generic implementation of the property panel. 
The Add-on implementation now allows for developers to fully customize which properties are available. 
In addition, the `builder` functions have been refactored as these have been hard to understand. 
All builder functions have been combined to the `appBuilder` function. 
The selected properties from the Add-ons are now accessed via the single `BuildContext` parameter which further simplifies usage of the builder function.
Furthermore, the refactor of the API allowed to fix the existing `MediaQuery` issues.
