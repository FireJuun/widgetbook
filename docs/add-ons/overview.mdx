# Overview

Add-ons are a fully customizable way of configuring Widgetbook with changable properties.
Developers can use the existing Add-ons or define their own custom Add-ons.

<Info>
    This section describes Add-ons in general.
    As every Add-on works a bit different, make sure to also read into the documentation of the Add-on implementation that you are using for your Widgetbook.

Out of the box, Widgetbook features the following Add-ons:
- `ThemeAddon` for theming
    - `MaterialThemeAddon`
    - `CupertinoThemeAddon`
    - `CustomThemeAddon`
- `FrameAddon` for previewing use-cases on specific device sizes
- `LocalizationAddon` for testing different locales
- `TextScaleAddon` for different test scales and accessibility

## Customizing an Add-on

Most Add-ons follow the pattern to require a `setting` property that allows developers to populate an Add-on with the required data.
The `Setting` data model has one or more properties to provide the data that can be selected in the user-interface and also has one or more properties to define the active data item. 

```dart title="MaterialThemeAddon example"
final themeAddon = MaterialThemeAddon(
  setting: MaterialThemeSetting(
    themes: [
      WidgetbookTheme(
        name: 'Light',
        data: lightTheme(),
      ),
      WidgetbookTheme(
        name: 'Dark',
        data: darkTheme(),
      ),
    ],
    activeTheme: WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Light',
      data: lightTheme(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

In the `MaterialThemeAddon` Add-on example, the available themes are defined with the `themes` property while the active selection on startup of the Widgetbook app is defined with the `activeTheme` property.

## Accessing Add-on values

Add-ons follow the pattern to expose the selected value(s) via the `BuildContext`.
Therefore, the selected option is accessible in the [`appBuilder` method](/getting-started/configuration#customize-how-use-cases-are-previewed) and [use-case builder method](/getting-started/configuration#adding-components-to-the-catalogue).
